Hello, 

The data I used can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata

Also, please consider that the main focus of the analysis is on the multiple linear regression, and not the propensity score matching. 
Propensity score matching is added after I finished my linear regression analysis, to show some extra proof that I used the materials from the class that we learned in the last 6 weeks of class. Thank you so much and Have a nice holiday & a happy new year :)
