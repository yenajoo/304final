# 304final

Hello, 

The data I used can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata

Also, please consider that the main focus of the analysis is on the multiple linear regression, and not the propensity score matching. 

Propensity score matching is added after I finished my linear regression analysis, to show some extra evidence that I understood and used the materials from the class that we learned for the last 6 weeks of class. Please be mindful of the fact that because of these reasons I made whole another section for the propensity score matching and briefly went over it. Model diagnostic for logistic regression is mentioned shortly, but it is not covered entirely because of the redundancy of doing it twice.  

Thank you so much and Have a nice holiday & a happy new year :)
